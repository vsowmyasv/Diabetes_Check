## _Introduction_
Diabetes is one of deadliest diseases in the world. It is not only a disease but also a creator of different kinds of diseases like heart attack, blindness, kidney diseases, etc. The normal identifying process is that patients need to visit a diagnostic centre, consult their doctor, and sit tight for a day or more to get their reports. Moreover, every time they want to get their diagnosis report, they may waste their money in vain. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is defined as a group of metabolic disorders mainly caused by abnormal insulin secretion and/or action. Insulin deficiency results in elevated blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) and impaired metabolism of carbohydrates, fat and proteins. DM is one of the most common endocrine disorders, affecting more than 200 million people worldwide. The onset of diabetes is estimated to rise dramatically in the upcoming years. DM can be divided into several distinct types. However, there are two major clinical types, type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), according to the etiopathology of the disorder. T2D appears to be the most common form of diabetes (90% of all diabetic patients), mainly characterized by insulin resistance. The main causes of T2D include lifestyle, physical activity, dietary habits and heredity, whereas T1D is thought to be due to autoimmunological destruction of the Langerhans islets hosting pancreatic-β cells. T1D affects almost 10% of all diabetic patients worldwide, with 10% of them ultimately developing idiopathic diabetes. Other forms of DM, classified based on insulin secretion profile and/or onset, include Gestational Diabetes, endocrinopathies, MODY (Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young), neonatal, mitochondrial, and pregnancy diabetes. The symptoms of DM include polyuria, polydipsia, and significant weight loss among others. Diagnosis depends on blood glucose levels (fasting plasma glucose = 7.0 mmol/L.

## _Proposed Method_
Classification is one of the most important decision making techniques in many real world problem. In this work, the main objective is to classify the data as diabetic or non-diabetic and improve the classification accuracy. For many classification problem, the higher number of samples chosen but it doesn’t lead to higher classification accuracy. In many cases, the performance of algorithm is high in the context of speed but the accuracy of data classification is low. The main objective of our model is to achieve high accuracy. Classification accuracy can be increase if we use much of the data set for training and few data sets for testing. This survey has analysed various classification techniques for classification of diabetic and non-diabetic data. Thus, it is observed that techniques like Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Artificial Neural Network are most suitable for implementing the Diabetes prediction system.
The following features have been provided to help us predict whether a person is diabetic or not:
-	Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
-	Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
-	Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
-	Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
-	Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
-	BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/ (height in m)2)
-	Diabetes Pedigree Function: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
-	Age: Age (years)
-	Outcome: Class variable (0 if non-diabetic, 1 if diabetic)

## _Methodology_
Feature Selection is one of the key concepts of machine learning that has an immense effect on the efficiency of the algorithm. The DM data features that are utilized to train ML models have a big effect on results. Feature Selection will be the first and most significant step in the design of the model. There are several benefits of DM feature selection like (1) Decreases overfitting: less repetitive data means less ability to render noise-based decisions; (2) Increases accuracy: less inaccurate data means improved simulation accuracy; (3) Decreases processing time: fewer data points decrease algorithm complexity and training of the algorithms become faster.
There are two key specific methods to the DM feature selection method. The first is to create a filter-based method where the DM feature set is filtered out before the development of the model. The second method is to utilize an ML algorithm to test various subgroups of DM features and eventually pick the one which is producing the best recognition accuracy. This procedure will be utilized to construct a mathematical model in the end. Techniques in this group are considered as wrapper approaches since the resultant algorithm covers the entire selection process.
Various types of features such as shape features, colour features, texture features, and text features are utilized in DM research. The following subsections include a short overview of the following features.

## _Impementation_
This research provided a review of ML-based techniques and AI-based techniques used to build automatic DM detection systems. Primary articles are chosen from the Scopus and PubMed research database. Also, two separate filters are used to choose the standard primary research articles for this analysis and to reduce the prejudice of the selection study. A total of 107 research articles is chosen for this review after a thorough screening. This review addresses chosen articles focused on five specific factors, including databases, ML-related DM detection and diagnosis, classification and diagnosis methods, AI-driven intelligent assistants for DM patients, and performance metrics used to assess the efficiency of the classification model.

Researchers used either self-created, unique datasets or publicly available datasets in the selected articles (see Table 1). In a variety of articles, several researchers have established their own unique (self-created) datasets obtained from some system or hospital. Our analysis showed that a variety of experiments utilized unique datasets. However, there are two significant flaws in these experiments. First, the established classification model is focused on a specific modality in which the data are obtained from one hospital and extracted from one specific tool. Hence, the classification model learned from the data obtained could not be implemented on a larger scale. The reason behind this is there are so many diagnostic tools that collect DM data these days. Each system can have its standard with various features and parameters. It is also recommended that data on multimodal DM should be collected to establish a classification architecture where data on DM should be collected from various clinics and data collected from a range of diagnostic instruments. Such a multimodal dataset can generate a more reliable classification model that can be applied on a broader scale. Second, in a variety of tests, unique databases include a limited amount of DM results. The stated classification model that therefore suffers from over-fitting or under-fitting. Therefore, several researchers have utilized publicly available reference databases to address these weaknesses. However, in these researches, there is still a need for more precise DM detection and diagnosis systems that can boost recognition efficiency in terms of precision and time. It is therefore strongly recommended that a structured publicly accessible diabetic dataset be utilized to treat the DM disease at its stage.

Researchers have used either ML-based methods or AI-based strategies to identify and treat DM and to assist patients with DM. Of the 107 studies chosen, 79 studies have used ML-based strategies and the remaining 28 used AI-based approaches. The most critical challenge in ML-based methods is to find valuable features that can be given as inputs to ML algorithms to generate a classification architecture. Many researchers have therefore used several features (i.e., shape features, texture features, colour features, and text features) to test the efficiency of the classification to determine which features may result in improved classification results. Several ML-based researches have confirmed that text, texture, and combination of shape, texture, and colour features are results-oriented and discriminatory in the diagnosis of DM. Therefore, it can be inferred that text-based, texture-based, and fusion of shape-based, colour-based, and texture-based features are the most biased features of DM recognition algorithms and can yield promising outcomes for scientists operating in the area of ML-based DM detection and diagnosis and classification. The probable explanations for the significance of these features may be that, in shape features, the outline and structure of different images can be extracted of diabetic retinopathy, such as soft and hard exudates, micro aneurysms and haemorrhages. However, in these features, the region, and diameter, circularity, axis length, compactness, etc. can be measured of each specific lesion relevant to the retinopathy image. Also, texture and colour features can be used widely as such features offer valuable details on the appearance of diabetic retinopathy images that yield successful outcomes. Also, text-based features give the information based on age, glucose level, heredity, ECG based features like slope, amplitude, and width, etc. which are very useful to identify DM at an initial stage.

In ML methods, researchers have utilized either supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement ML algorithms to identify DM. However, a variety of experiments have used supervised machine learning methods as opposed to unsupervised approaches. Since supervised ML algorithms are more reliable than unsupervised algorithms (Guerra et al., 2011). In comparison, supervised ML algorithms learn the classification rules from recognized labelled samples (i.e., training set). This can be shown from the collected papers that the supervised ML methods have produced improved classification outcomes relative to unsupervised methods. In several studies that used supervised ML methods, Deep Neural Network and Support Vector Machine reported better classification outcomes followed by Random Forest and Ensemble Classifier. The most prominent and widely utilized DL architecture in the selected 79 studies is CNN and Deep CNN, which has been utilized in several studies. It can be concluded from this that CNN is the most appropriate deep neural network especially for diabetic detection and diagnosis and usually for the treatment of all other medical problems. For diabetic detection and diagnosis where DL is used, we found that deep architectures worked well while there are fewer levels. However, if the class number rises, the efficiency of the DL system is unsatisfactory. However, in a variety of studies, authors have utilized several ML algorithms for derived feature vectors to build classification models and evaluate which algorithm achieves better performance on the datasets utilized. In comparison, some researchers have used only one ML method to build a classification model. Yet, according to no free lunch theorem (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014), no single ML algorithm is ideal for all image types. Thus, one can test the output of many ML algorithms and see which one will generate the finest possible outcomes.

Out of 107 studies, 28 articles have mentioned the benefit of using artificial intelligent assistant for DM patients. Digitization has enabled big data technology more important in the field of healthcare. The introduction of smart apps has facilitated the transition to digital healthcare. Artificial intelligent devices also made self-management and personalization of DM accessible for patients. Sensors can send data to mobile devices and diabetics may track their blood glucose levels through such systems. AI algorithms have enabled methods for forecasting glucose that help to combat DM effectively. They will emulate the cognitive functions of humans. AI is exploiting the explosion of medical information. AI is improving health quality for people with DM. In various studies, researchers have mentioned the use of different intelligent assistants to help patients in self-management and personalization of DM especially for type-I diabetes like self-monitoring of blood glucose, blood pressure, pulse rate, etc. Some researchers have mentioned the benefit of using chatbots where the consumer asks the chatbot to count his calories and also to obtain knowledge on health and nutrition awareness from the system.

Most of the scientists utilized specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy to test the efficiency of their classifiers. This mixture is often utilized for DM prediction utilizing machine learning techniques. Another often utilized fusion by the researchers’ community is Accuracy, Specificity, Sensitivity, and AUC. This combination of measures is sufficient for DL methods where there are unnecessary groups in DM evidence and the authors have balanced groups by that or choosing approximately identical numbers in diabetic data in specific levels of training and research sets.

## _Conclusion_
Machine learning has the great ability to revolutionize the diabetes risk prediction with the help of advanced computational methods and availability of large amount of epidemiological and genetic diabetes risk dataset. Detection of diabetes in its early stages is the key for treatment. This work has described a machine learning approach to predicting diabetes levels. The technique may also help researchers to develop an accurate and effective tool that will reach at the table of clinicians to help them make better decision about the disease status.
